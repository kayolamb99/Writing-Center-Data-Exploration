# Writing Center Data Exploration

## Initial Ask

This presentation served as the initial dive into raw data output by myWCOnline. Initial ask was to measure utilization of the center with 
regard to student demographics, as well as performance of tutor survey scores over time.

## Implementation

Utilized Tableau to create all visualizations. Performed some minor data wrangling to create the 'L2' feature.
If a student is a native English speaker, this student is categorized as non-L2, while all other students are categorized as L2.
This feature is of great importance, given the Center's commitment to improving the service quality and utlization of these students 

## Results

Presented findings to 2019-2020 cohort of new Writing Center tutors. Analysis spawned an increased initiatve towards data utilization within the center,
as well as the creation of an Internal Health Dashboard that examines important center metrics and their performance over time.
